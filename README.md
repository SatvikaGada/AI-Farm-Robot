# AI-Powered Smart Pest Management Robot

## Problem Statement

Agricultural pests significantly reduce crop yields, directly threatening food security and farmers' livelihoods. Traditional pest control methods rely heavily on chemical pesticides, causing environmental pollution, soil degradation, loss of beneficial insects, and health risks for farmers and consumers. Manual pest monitoring is also labor-intensive and inefficient.

## Our Solution

We have developed an AI-powered farm robot for smart and sustainable pest management. It is designed to:

- Move autonomously on wheels across farm fields.
- Detect pests using nanosensors and infrared sensors.
- Use an AI model to classify pests as good or harmful.
- Capture harmful pests using a suction mechanism.
- Convert captured pests into biomass energy to power the robot.
- Use reinforcement learning to identify high-risk pest zones.
- Switch between bioenergy, solar energy, and battery based on availability.

This solution improves farm efficiency, reduces pesticide use, and promotes sustainable agriculture.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab (for model development and training)
- OpenCV (Image processing and Laplacian filtering)
- TensorFlow / Keras (CNN Model for pest classification)
